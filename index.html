<p style="color: blue;">  Nigeria follows the 6+3+3 system of primary-secondary education. Six years of primary education are followed <br>
    by three years of junior secondary education and three years of senior secondary education. <br>

Elementary education in Nigeria is six years in duration, and runs from grade one through six (ages 6-12). <br>
    Students are awarded the Primary School Leaving Certificate on completion of Grade 6, based on continuous <br>
    assessment. Junior Secondary Education is 3 years (ages 13-16) Grades 7-9. Students are awarded the Basic <br>
    Education Certificate (BEC) on completion of Grade 9. Students must achieve passes in six subjects, including <br>
    English and mathematics, to pass the Basic Education Certificate Examination. <br>
- Senior Secondary Education is 3 years (ages 16-19) Grades 10-12. <br>
- Upon completion of Grade 12 in May/June, students sit for the Senior School Certificate Examination (SSCE). <br>
    They are examined in a minimum of seven and a maximum of nine subjects, including Mathematics and English, <br>
    which are compulsory. Successful candidates are awarded the Senior Secondary Certificate (SSC). <br>
- Most universities require passes in at least five SSC subjects and an average grade of at least ‘credit’ <br>
    level (C6) or better to be considered for admission. <br>

SSC examinations are offered by the West African Examination Council and the National Examination Council (NECO).<br>

The Federal Ministry of Education is responsible for overall policy formation and quality control. Secondary School <br>
    education is largely the responsibility of state governments and Elementary School education the responsibility <br>
    of local governments.
